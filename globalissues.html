<h1>Globaly gender equaliy is even worse, an example of one of the worst if not the worst is Saudi Arabia, Saudi Arabia is considered to have the worst women's rights because of Islam law and because of tradition and social norms. Because women are considered minors under men sometimes a women will need to have permission from her son to do something like travel outside to do something.  Because of Islam all women have to wear clothing that covers everything but their eyes in order to not seduce a man, because of Islam law women cannot drive, women have to do chores at home instead of attending a job, women cannot attend school without permission.<br>

“Female workers in South Korea earn a third less than their male counterparts on average, the highest gender wage gap among Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development member nations. Labor force participation is high among women between the ages of 20 and 25, but shifts to part-time employment in later years. Park Geun-hye became the nation’s first female president in 2013. She promised expanded child care and female management development programs during her campaign.” <br>

“Malaysia patriarchal society typical of Asian nations, coupled with conservative Muslim law does not encourage gender equality. The 30% Club, a British organization that aims to have 30 percent female representation on leadership boards, launched a chapter in Malaysia in May 2015. The country is one of the poorest performing upper-middle-income nations when it comes to gender equality, especially in terms of female political empowerment, according to the World Economic Forum. As others improve, Malaysia’s measures remain relatively stagnant and reflect a downward trend  in Global Gender Gap Index rankings.” <br>
