<h1>Gender equality happens Worldwide, and in some countries more than others. Locally gender inequality happens when men get paid more than women do (when they are in the same job).  What companies can do to make this more equal is pay them equally, let paternity/maternity leaves more flexible, they shouldn't be penalized by wanting to spend time with their family. Study shows that being an active and involved dad will benefit their kids and lowers blood pressure, lower rates of cardiovascular disease, and gives you a longer life.
 Some Gender inequality examples are the womens soccer team getting paid less than the mens soccer team, and the womens team performes better than the mens team.
 “Yet if the four women had pooled the $75,000 they each received from the U.S. Soccer Federation for winning, it still wouldn't equal the roughly $400,000 each member of the men's team would have made if his team had won the same tournament. Because of that pay disparity, Lloyd, Rapinoe, Solo, and two other teammates filed a complaint with the federal government last spring. It accused the U.S. Soccer Federation of wage discrimination for paying women less than men, despite equal work--and more success--from the women.”

 <h1>Saudi Arabia is considered to have the worst women's rights because of Islamic law and because of tradition and social norms. Because women are considered minors under men sometimes a women will need to have permission from her son to do something like travel outside to do something.  Because of Islamic law women have to wear clothing that covers everything but their eyes in order to not seduce a man, because of Islamic law women cannot drive, women have to do chores at home instead of attending a job, women cannot attend school without permission.
